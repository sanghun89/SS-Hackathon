# Note in a bottle
A message in a bottle is a musical note,   
the sea is the internet,  
locations on the seashore are people.

As a bottle reaches each location,  
a person can listen, add or subtract  
something from the existing song  
and then send the bottle back out to sea. 

The sea will then randomly send the bottle  
to another person on another shore.
